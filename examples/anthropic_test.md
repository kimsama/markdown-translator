# AI Translation Test

This is a test document to verify that our **markdown translator** works correctly with the Anthropic API.

## Features to Test

- Basic text translation
- **Bold formatting** preservation
- *Italic formatting* preservation
- `Code snippets` should remain untranslated
- Lists and bullet points

### Code Block Test

```python
def hello_world():
    print("This code should not be translated")
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Sample Content

The AI translator should handle technical documentation while preserving all markdown formatting. This includes:

1. Numbered lists
2. Bullet points
3. Headers and subheaders
4. Code blocks and inline code

> This is a blockquote that should be translated while preserving the formatting.

Thank you for testing the translation functionality!
